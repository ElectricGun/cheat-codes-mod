# Mobile Support
Added the long requested mobile support!<br>
Simply tap on the surge-wall button and type in the code.<br>
To enter special characters such as "enter", just them out normally. For example, Konami on mobile would be "wwssadadbaenter". (THIS MIGHT CHANGE IN THE FUTURE)<br>
# Cheat Codes Mod
Adds GTA San Andreas style cheat codes to Mindustry.<br>
To activate them, simply type out the strings of text corresponding to them until something happens.<br>
Mistakes and typos will reset the strings, so make sure you type them out correctly.<br>
Only works in game.<br>
